SORTING AND FILTERING ROWS
Sorting Rows
16 min
Exploring datasets is easier if the rows have a predictable structure. For example, the vehicles dataset would be simpler to inspect if we knew that the models were listed in chronological order.

The syntax to sort a DataFrame df in pandas by a particular column is

df = df.sort_values(
  by = 'Column'
)

where

.sort_values() is a DataFrame method
by is a keyword that receives the label of the column to sort by
By default, .sort_values() will sort from lowest to highest (or, for text, from A to Z). Passing False to the ascending parameter will sort from highest to lowest (or Z to A):

df = df.sort_values(
  by = 'Column',
  ascending = False
)

Here’s an example of calling

.sort_values(by='year',
    ascending=False)

on a small DataFrame of vehicle models:

Original	Sorted
Make	Year
Ford	2022
Toyota	2019
Ford	2017
Toyota	2020
Make	Year
Ford	2022
Toyota	2020
Toyota	2019
Ford	2017
Notice how the rows have been re-ordered to have the most recent model at the top, and the oldest at the bottom.

Sorting an index
Calling .sort_values() will only sort values by a column. To sort rows by the index values instead, use .sort_index(). There’s no need to specify a by parameter, since the method will already sort by the index.

Like .sort_values(), passing True/False to ascending= controls the order of the index sort.

How to Use Your Jupyter Notebook:

You can run a cell in the Notebook to the right by placing your cursor in the cell and clicking the Run button or the Shift+Enter/Return keys.
When you are ready to evaluate the code in your Notebook, press the Save button at the top of the Notebook or use the control/command+s keys before clicking the Test Work button at the bottom. Be sure to save your solution code in the cell marked ## YOUR SOLUTION HERE ## or it will not be evaluated.
When you are ready to move on, click Next.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
First, run the Setup cell to import libraries and datasets.

Sort vehicles by year from lowest (oldest) to highest (newest).

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Sort vehicles by best_mpge from highest to lowest.

Note: mpge stands for miles per gallon equivalent, and is a standard calculation used to compare different fuels (like electric) with standard vehicles. The field best_mpge is the highest mpge reported under all circumstances (e.g. highway driving versus city, hybrid performance, etc.)
