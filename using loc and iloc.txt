Selecting Specific Rows
16 min
Sometimes, we’re only interested in looking at certain rows and columns of a DataFrame. We can select sections of a DataFrame using two methods: .loc[] and .iloc[].

We’ll explore how both of these work using the following mini-DataFrame df.

Make	Year
0	Ford	2017
1	Ford	2022
2	Toyota	2019
3	Toyota	2020
Before demonstrating .loc[] and .iloc[], we’ll sort df by Year. This isn’t necessary to use .loc[] or .iloc[], but it will make the difference between them clearer.

	Make	Year
1	Ford	2022
3	Toyota	2020
2	Toyota	2019
0	Ford	2017
Note that the index is now out-of-order. This will be important later on.

Using .loc[]
The .loc[] index works using the index labels, and the syntax is

df.loc[list_of_row_labels, list_of_column_labels]

For example, the code

df.loc[[0,3],['Make']]

would perform the following selection:

Full DataFrame	Selection

	Make	Year
1	Ford	2022
3	Toyota	2020
2	Toyota	2019
0	Ford	2017

	Make
0	Ford
3	Toyota

The first list ([0,3]) instructs .loc[] to select the rows labelled 0 and 3 in order. The second list (['Make']) instructs .loc[] to select only the column labelled Make.

Using .iloc[]
The .iloc[] index works using the position of the rows and columns, instead of their labels. The syntax is essentially the same, except that the lists contain positions instead of labels:

df.iloc[list_of_row_positions, list_of_column_positions]

where

both the row positions and column positions start at 0
Rows are counted top to bottom
columns are counted from left to right
For example, the code

df.iloc[[0,3],[0]]

performs the selection

Full DataFrame	Selection
	Make	Year
1	Ford	2022
3	Toyota	2020
2	Toyota	2019
0	Ford	2017
	Make
1	Ford
0	Ford
Here, the list [0,3] instructs .iloc to select only the first row (position 0) and the fourth row (position 3). The column list [0] instructs .iloc to select the first column, which is the column labelled Make.

It is very common to make what are called off-by-one errors by starting positions at 1 instead of 0. For example, it’s natural to write the list [1,4] to select the first and fourth rows, instead of the list [0,3]. Be patient, and remember to check for this if you’re receiving the wrong selection from .iloc[].
